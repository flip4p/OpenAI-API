This project reads text from a .txt file, processes it using OpenAI's API, and generates an HTML page as output. The text is formatted into a prompt and sent to the API, which returns HTML content. The final result is saved as an HTML file that displays the formatted content. This is useful for transforming raw text into structured web pages with the power of AI.


The main2.py file contains the Python program code. When executed, it generates the initial version of the ZADANIE_AI.html file. The ZADANIE_AI_CSS.html file contains custom modifications that I personally applied using CSS to style the content of ZADANIE_AI.html.
